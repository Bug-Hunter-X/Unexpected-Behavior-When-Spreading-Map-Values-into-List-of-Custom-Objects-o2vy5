# Dart: Unexpected Behavior with Map Value Spreading

This repository demonstrates a subtle yet important bug in Dart related to the spread operator (...) when used with maps containing custom objects.  The bug showcases a situation where spreading a map's values directly into a list containing custom objects might produce unexpected behavior unless the implications are carefully considered.

The `bug.dart` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.dart` provides a corrected version.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.dart` using the Dart VM.
3. Observe the output.
4. Compare the output with the expected behavior.

## Solution
The solution involves more careful consideration of the type handling and data flow when combining lists and map values.
